# GPTogether

GPTogether turns GPT prompts into a social experience. Connect with others who are curious about similar topics. Explore the world through the unique lens of collaborative prompting. Inspire together in the age of GPT. Forget social networks. Experience the magic of prompt networks.
GPTogether uses Next.js for the client side, FastAPI for the backend, and an ML module using vector DB.

## Features

GPTogether allows you to collaborate and explore LLMs in the following way:
1. Start a chatGPT conversion and choose its privacy selection
- `Public` means that the conversation will be vectorized, analyzed, and used to find similar users and prompts
- `First Prompt Public` only uses the first prompt to categorize and keeps the rest of the conversation private. This allows you to find similar people while not sharing the content of those chats. 
- `Private` does not share any data with other users
2. Discover people who share your interests
- GPTogher creates vector embeddings from your prompts and conversations and finds similar users, prompts, and conversations based on these. 
- Click on the `Connect` tab to find users that share similar interests. For instance, you might see that Alice shares interests in "Resume and Cover Letter Writing Tips, Space Facts, and EV Cars. 
- Users can add social links to let others connect with them directly
3. Discover similar conversations and prompts
- Select `View Prompts` to see the common prompts. Find inspiration and explore how others converse with the LLM on similar topics.

## Frontend

This frontend repository is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and includes a comprehensive design system. It integrates Firebase authentication for secure user authentication.
The app allows users to chat with ChatGPT, receive prompt suggestions, and explore similar conversations based on their chats with ChatGPT. Additionally, users can find and connect with people who share similar interests.

## Backend

GPTogether’s backend code is written in Python which enhances the capabilities of ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. It plays a critical role in handling the server-side logic, data storage, and retrieval that powers the chatbot’s natural language processing and conversation management.

## NLP

The NLP part leverages **semantic similarity search** in several scenarios: for suggesting **auto-complete** while typing suggestions, for **user-to-user** similarity, and for finding **similar conversations** for a given conversation or a list of prompts. The auto-complete similarities are implemented by cosine similarities of unit vectors, generated by an open source model `Muennighoff/SGPT`. For more details see: `nlp/utils/ai.py`.

## Future features

1. Support for browser extensions

    In the future, we hope to build a browser extension to initiate GPTogether anywhere on the web and recommend particular prompts and conversations based on various parameters.

2. Vector database integration to store vectors data

    Currently, we use Postgres to store vectors, but it is not fundamentally built to store vector data. We plan to use a vector database to store the vector data to enable faster retrieval and processing.

3. Exploration and fine-tuning of other LLMs

    Additional models and AI systems will be included to allow cross-model exploration.

4. Tokenomics

    Give incentives to the creators of the most used conversations and prompts.

5. Censorship

   Remember the incident where Samsung workers leaked trade secrets Via ChatGPT? We hope to build in-house algorithms to prevent such incidents. 

6. In-app chat integration between users

    We aim to expand collaborative prompting to include the ability to chat, comment, and explore the embedding space of LLMs in real-time.
